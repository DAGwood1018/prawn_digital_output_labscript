# Prawn Digital Output Labscript Driver

This program allows the [Prawn Digital Output](https://github.com/pmiller2022/prawn_digital_output/tree/main) code to work with Labscript. This code was developed off the [labscript driver for digital outputs](https://github.com/carterturn/zwierlein_labscript_user_devices/tree/basis/prawn_do) developed by Carter Turnbaugh.
